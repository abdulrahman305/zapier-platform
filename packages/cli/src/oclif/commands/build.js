BuildCommand.description = `Build a pushable zip from the current directory.

This command does the following:

* Creates a temporary folder
* Copies all code into the temporary folder
* Adds an entry point: \`zapierwrapper.js\`
* Generates and validates app definition.
* Detects dependencies via esbuild (optional, on by default)
* Zips up all needed \`.js\` files. If you want to include more files, add a "includeInBuild" property (array with strings of regexp paths) to your \`${CURRENT_APP_FILE}\`.
* Moves the zip to \`${BUILD_PATH}\` and \`${SOURCE_PATH}\` and deletes the temp folder

This command is typically followed by \`zapier upload\`.`;
